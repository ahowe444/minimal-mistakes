<title>Optimality Theoretic Ethics</title>

This paper was borne out of my coursework in moral philosophy and linguistic theory. In ethics, the area of 
philosophy dedicated to how we ought to act and what is right and wrong. Though most people have an intrinsic moral 
compass, others do not. Some attribute their morals to some objective moral law laid down by a deity, while others
attribute their sense of morals to their upbringing. They even can be attributed to evolutionary biology. Just as
there are several ideas about where morals come from, there are also several theories of how we ought to act. One 
particularly popular theory is <em>utilitarianism</em> built around the idea of maximizing pleasure and minimizing 
pain. Utilitarianism and other similar frameworks (ethical egoism) benefit from their intuitiveness, but they've 
faced numerous "challenges". The canonical objections are Nozick's experience machine and the trolley problem. 
Then, alternative theories like Kant's categorical imperative offer solutions to many of the failure points
within utilitarianism, but even Kant's theory has its flaws - it prohibits lying in all cases, even to prevent a 
group of Nazis from tracking down the location of a family of Jews stowed away in a safe house. <br><br>

It is clear that in everyday life, moral values come into conflict with one another: "Should one steal to 
feed their family?" This is where optimality theory, a framework for evaluation a set of potential "candidates"
based on a set of "constraints" enters into the picture. When I first had this thought relating these two 
seemingly disparate ideas, I found a paper by Steve and Monica Parker, cited below. Amalia Gnanadesikan also
 and Steve Parker provided helpful feedback and critique on the paper. I submitted this work to the 
<em>Prometheus</em> Philosophy conference, but it was not accepted.
