## My Plan for Summer 2k19

As I start to gear up for some serious training this summer I want to reflect on past years of summer training
and lay out a plan for the rest of the summer. This summer will be by far my most consistent and intense block of
training. Why? Because in high school I had fairly high intensity, but I wasn't nearly as high mileage wise as I am now.
Additionally, I am much more consistent - particularly when it comes to long runs. There are a couple things that I want to 
note here that I believe will help me **recover** better than ever before.

* Getting more sleep - this past Saturday I did a morning run, reloaded, chilled out and then took a nap 
before my evening double - I want this day to be my template for the future.
* I have been reloading with CarboGain following every practice - when one gets in the habit of replenishing
one's glycogen stores immediately after aerobic exercise, the body is amazingly able to absorb MORE muscle glycogen
than it previously could - the key is timing and consistency.
* I will make sure that I am taking my Vitamin D3 (the body's preferred form of Vitamin D when it comes to absorption). 
Though I have not had any issues with stress fractures - I would never want to become negligent and risk an injury.
* Continuing to use Strava - this helps me track my weekly mileage and pace providing an invaluable comparison to previous years.
* My motto for this season - **There is no such thing as overtraining, there is only... under-recovery.**
